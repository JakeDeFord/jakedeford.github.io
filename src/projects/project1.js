                Purchased a Dancing Groot from Amazon and was not pleased with its functions. The songs programmed into him were not authentic and were knockoffs.
                I opened the toy up and replaced the internal microcontroller and installed my own. I used a nuvaton microcontroller that had a speaker controller and LED controller already built in.
                I then ripped some youtube videos for music from the movies Groot was in and individualy edited the mp3 files to improve their performance for a toy speaker.
